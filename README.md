This repository contains some simple [R
Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications that I developed to
illustrate topics I cover in my graduate course on [Population
Genetics](http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/uncommon-ground/eeb348/). Each
of the applications is hosted at shinyapps.io. You'll find them
embedded in various lecture details on my course website. Below you'll
find a list of direct links to make access a bit more convenient.

* [Estimating allele frequencies with the EM algorithm](https://keholsinger.shinyapps.io/EM-algorithm-for-allele-frequencies/)
* [Genetics of geographically structured populations](https://keholsinger.shinyapps.io/F-statistics/)
* [Viability selection at one locus with two alleles](https://keholsinger.shinyapps.io/Viability-selection/)
