This repository contains some simple [R
Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) applications that I developed to
illustrate some topics I cover in my graduate course on [Population
Genetics](http://darwin.eeb.uconn.edu/uncommon-ground/eeb348/). Each
of the applications is hosted at shinyapps.io. You'll find them
embedded in various lecture details on my course websiter. Here are
direct links to make it a bit easier.
